Hostelworld Android technical test

Summary:

Create an Android native app that will obtain a list of property details from an online json
resource and display them in a table view.
There should be a screen to list all the properties returned for a city as well as one to see
the details for those properties.

The property list should contain at least:
• the property name
• the property type
• the lowest price per night
• the overall rating percentage
• a thumbnail image of the property if one is present

The property detail screen should contain at least:
• the property name
• the address
• address1
• address2
• city
• country
• the property description
• the property directions
• at least one of the images from the property

Implementation notes:
A mock api has been set up for one city with 20 properties. Documentation can be viewed
at http://docs.practical3.apiary.io/. There are two main types of call: to get properties in a
city, and to get an individual property.
City call: xxxx.apiary-mock.com/cities/1530/properties/
the property calls can be generated by using the id's returned in the city call for example
xxxx.apiary-mock.com/properties/17803
